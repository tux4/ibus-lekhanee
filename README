Input Method for Indic Languages for IBus.
Prasanna Suman

This is a quick and dirty code as a proof of concept for better IM for Indic Languages based on IBus template.
I have been working with Nepali as an example although I plan to make it easily extendible for other Indic scripts.

To run, make sure your IBus daemon is running. [Alt]+[F2]:ibus-daemon
Next, run python ./engine/main.py
 
 The standard IBus shortcuts are used to activate and change the IM, so use [Ctrl]+[Space] to start, [Alt]+[/] to switch.
